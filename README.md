# Path-Visualizer
An application that displays BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra Algorithm. <br>
You can add the initial start of the search, the target, and walls.<br>
After the insertion you can start the search and have an option of choosing a Breadth first search, Depth First Search, or Dijkstra to find the shortest path to the target. <br>

## Here is an example of the application running: <br>

## Purpose
This purpose of this program was to demostrate my knowledge of the algorithms used and OOP with C++. <br>
Data Structures used in this program are: stack, queue, priority queue, and vectors. <br>
Libraries used: [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) <br>

## How to run the program on windows.
The executable file is located in the Debug Folder. Open it and you will be able to run the program.

## BFS 
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored. <br>

## DFS
Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. <br>

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm (/ˈdaɪkstrəz/ DYKE-strəz) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.<br>
